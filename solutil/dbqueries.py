    Retrieve setup variables from .env environment file, e.g., BelVis username & password.

    Extract 15-minute resolution time series from various BelVis database Mandanten.

        - **ts_id** (int): The BelVis time series ID in integer format, e.g., 404212442.
        - **date_from** (dt): A datetime object representing the start date of the export window.
                          Start date is inclusive of `date_from` value, i.e., the start date will
                          be included in the extraction range. Format examples:
                          - datetime(2024, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
                          - datetime.strptime(date_string, format)
                          - any other datetime object
        - **date_to** (dt): A datetime object representing the end date of the export window.
                            The end date is not included in the queried output.
        - **mandant_user** (str): Username for the BelVis Mandant.
        - **mandant_pwd** (str): Password for the selected BelVis Mandant.
        - **mandant_addr"" (str): Address of the selected BelVis Mandant.
        - **offset_summertime** (bool): Indicator whether summertime is offset, i.e., whether
                                        timestamps are in Etc/GMT-1 or local time. If False, code will

                                        first convert to CET before Etc/GMT-1.
        - **col_name** (str): Column name which the output dataframe column should bear.
        - **USE_OLD_CX_ORACLE** (bool): Switch variable to use old database connection module. Deprecated under
                                        Python versions >3.6.

    Returns:

    Extract 1-hour resolution time series from various BelVis database Mandanten.

        - **ts_id** (int): The BelVis time series ID in integer format, e.g., 404212442.
        - **date_from** (dt): A datetime object representing the start date of the export window.
                              Start date is inclusive of `date_from` value, i.e., the start date will
                              be included in the extraction range. Format examples:
                              - datetime(2024, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
                              - datetime.strptime(date_string, format)
                              - any other datetime object
        - **date_to** (dt): A datetime object representing the end date of the export window.
                            The end date is not included in the queried output.
        - **mandant_user** (str): Username for the BelVis Mandant.
        - **mandant_pwd** (str): Password for the selected BelVis Mandant.
        - **mandant_addr"" (str): Address of the selected BelVis Mandant.
        - **offset_summertime** (bool): Indicator whether summertime is offset, i.e., whether
                                        timestamps are in CET or local time. If False, code will

                                        first convert to CET before Etc/GMT-1.
        - **col_name** (str): Column name which the output dataframe column should bear.
        - **USE_OLD_CX_ORACLE** (bool): Switch variable to use old database connection module. Deprecated under
                                        Python versions >3.6.

    Returns:
